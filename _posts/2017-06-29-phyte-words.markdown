It all started because I was curious about the origin of the word *neophyte,* someone who is new to a subject, a bit like a tyro[^1].

I grabbed a list of words ending in -phyte from [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_words_suffixed_with_-phyte).

[^1]: (Latin) A beginner or a novice

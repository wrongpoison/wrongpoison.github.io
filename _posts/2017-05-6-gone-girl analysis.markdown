*Gone Girl* is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies. I find the protagonist, Amy, uncomfortably relatable. But wait! Hear me out before you run off, far away from the crazy woman. I think the film draws on themes that are exceptionally relevant to human identity, regardless of our individual capacities for violence.

I think Amy struggles with very real and complicated problems of identity. She never gets to be the person she wants to be and the role she plays is always crafted to suit someone else's desires. She's down-to-earth and relaxed for Nick and elegant and cosmopolitan for Desi. Her parents even made "edits" to their daughter in their Amazing Amy books. This comes up most strikingly when the movie jumps to follow Amy driving away from her husband and she describes how girlfriends fit into a man's specific set of desires, as well as the cool girl speech. Away from all her relationships, she eats what she wants--a habit which later mortifies Desi when she eats extra crème brulee. He buys her hair dye and makeup, trying to make her into the version of her he imagines and desires her to be.

My favorite part of the entire movie is when Amy gives Nick a present at the very end. He opens it to reveal a pregnancy test, positive, nestled perfectly in a custom box. It's a metaphor for the characters' immobility within the social constraints that bind them. They are both trapped in roles dictated by others. The whole movie, people tell Amy how to act and who to be. She is her parents' "Amazing Amy," Nick's cool girl, Desi's sophisticated paramour. They demand that she behave in ways that conform to these identities they have developed for her. And at the end, she has her husband trapped, trapped the same way she has always been. They're both stuck in roles that they hate and can't escape. But Amy has become acutely aware of these roles and how people must play them and is able to successfully game the system for all its worth. If she cannot control her own identity, then she will at least force Nick into a mold that can satisfy some portion of her own desires.

>Nick never loved me. He loved a girl who doesn't exist. A girl I was pretending to be. The Cool Girl. Men always use that as the defining compliment, right? She’s a cool girl.
>Being Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker and dirty jokes, who plays videogames and chugs beer--loves threesomes and anal sex and jams chilidogs into my mouth like I’m hosting the world's biggest culinary gang-bang--while remaining a size 2, because cool girls are above all hot.
>Hot and understanding. Cool girls never get angry at their men, they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner. Go ahead! Shit on me, I don't mind, I'm the cool girl.
>I waited patiently-years-for the pendulum to swing the other way, for men to start reading Jane Austen, organize scrapbook parties, and make out with each other while we leer. And then we'd say, yeah, he's a cool guy.
>Instead, women across the nation colluded in our degradation! Pretty soon every girl was Cool Girl, and if you weren't, then there was something wrong with you.
>But it's tempting, to be Cool Girl. For someone like me, who likes to win, it's tempting to be the girl every guy wants. When I met Nick I knew that's what he wanted. For him, I was willing to try.
>I couldn't have been Cool Girl with anyone else. I wouldn't have wanted to. Nick teased things out in me I didn't know existed: A lightness, a humor, an ease.
>And I made him smarter, sharper. I forced him to rise to my level.
>I was happier for those few years, pretending to be someone else, than I ever have been before or after.
>But then it had to stop, because it wasn't me! I hated Nick for being surprised when I became me.
>He couldn't believe I didn't love wax-stripping my pussy raw and blowing him on request. That my fantasy baseball team was not a labor of love.
>It had to stop. Committing to Nick, feeling safe with Nick, being happy with Nick, made me realize that there was a Real Amy in there, and she was so much better, more interesting and complicated and challenging, than Cool Girl.
>But Nick wanted Cool Girl anyway.
>Can you imagine, finally showing your true self to your soulmate, and having him not like you?

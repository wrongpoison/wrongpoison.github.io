As of this weekend, I have officially completed a Masters degree in Data Science from Northwestern University. Yay! No more homework. I've learned so much from this program, but I've only just scratched the surface in what I can do. Hopefully, more of those projects will end up here. To celebrate, I'm linking to my final capstone project. This was a group project, so I can't take credit for all of it. I had an amazing team, and I think it's neat to show off a bit of what we did. The complete write-up, executive summary, and demo application are hosted here[https://wrongpoison.github.io/chevron_capstone/_pages/02_executive_summary/], on its own GitHub Page.

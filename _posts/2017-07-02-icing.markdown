I got "iced" for the first time this weekend. I was not amused, and it did not make for a great first impression. Despite this, I found myself brought into a new and foreign world: bro drinking. Since I'm a heartless, humorless troglodyte, I thought it might be interestign to examine this phenomenon in a pseudo-scientific/ethnographic thought experiment. Let me share with you some of my discoveries.

I went to a pool party with my SO and some of his coworkers. I'd only met a few of them before, though I'd heard a fair amount about them before. We arrived at the house and were standing around, making awkward introductions and shows of congeniality when one man turns to me. 

"M, I'm sorry," he said, "but you've been iced." He pulled a Smirnoff Ice from the fridge and placed it on the counter between us. I looked at him, completely oblivious to this apparently significant event. I looked at my SO, who laughed, and he told his coworker that he would need to explain to me what "icing" was. 

Apparently "icing" is when a bottle of the eponymous Smirnoff Ice is found (or otherwise appears) and the person being "iced" is required to get on one knee and chug it. I was not thrilled by this prospect, so I made a comment about how such a practice seemed juvenile and I wasn't interested. I sort of tried to pass it off as a joke, but--since I'm not particularly funny--I don't think it went over very well. Sensing growing discomfort, my SO grabbed the bottle, went down on one knee, and chugged it for me, to cheers from the rest of the group.

This whole encounter--though exquisitely painful--inspired a few questions that I later asked the coworkers. For instance, why does one take a knee when chugging the drink? Why Smirnoff Ice, a drink I understood to be on par with wine coolers in terms of emasculatory effects. One of the men at the party explained that the drinker takes a knee because they are a "bitch" and ought to get down on their knees to contribute to that image. The fact that the drinker only drops one knee evokes the pose of someone about to propose an engagement. (One partygoer did suggest that the drinker only got on one knee was to make it easier to balance while chugging.) The net effect seems to parody the typical dominance of the male sex. The choice of drink also contributes to this inverted display of power. "Ice" can also refer to diamonds, the quintescential centerpiece of an engagement ring. All of these combined elements combined mimic a proposal--typically done by men, and generally as a matter of pride and ownership--while forcing submission onto the drinker and subject of the display. Let us additionally (though briefly) consider that the demonstration of a person's ability to consume large quantities of liquid quickly coincides with the subject's ostensible capabilities for oral sex. Altogether, the practice of "icing" someone is intended to be derogatory, emasculating, and [x], all while mocking the broader practices of formalized monogamy.

But more than that, chugging drinks is stupid.

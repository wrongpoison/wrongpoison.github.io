Here is a visualization of all the colors mentioned in *The Complete Poems of Edgar Allen Poe*, found [here][poe-poems] on Project Gutenberg.

This is the [original plot][reddit-viz] that I made and shared on Reddit. I wanted the bars to be the same color as they represented, but this was messier than I anticipated. White also doesn't show up very well on a white background.

This month's /r/DataisBeautiful [r/DataIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) visualization contest uses a table with caffeine contents for several different items. I used the dataset to depict the number of servings someone would need to consume for the caffeine to kill them. These estimates are based off an estimation that 10g (10,000mg) would cause an overdose in the average human being.

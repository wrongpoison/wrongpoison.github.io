Full disclosure: this post is a riff off of [3 Million Instacart Orders, Open Sourced](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2).

I made a graph of the most popular items sold: 
![Most popular products]({{ site.url }}/assets/most_popular_items_ordered.pdf)

And a list of the 50 most popular items:

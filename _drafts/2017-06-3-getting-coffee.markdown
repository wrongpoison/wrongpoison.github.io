I've spent the last five days in SANS training, and though it's been absolutely *amazing*, it's definitely an intense experience. Six days, from 9am to 7pm, all packed to the brim with information. Thank goodness for the complimentary coffee. Except getting the into a cup and ready for my sleepy-eyed consumption is never quite as straight-forward as I'd hope. Several people all head to the dispensers at once, reaching over one another, stressed for time, overwhelmed with options--all of this coupled with dangerously hot liquids. I'm almost guaranteed to suffer a spill incident about every third cup, even in a stress-free environment. But still, there must be a better way to systematically offer people coffee.

### The Situation
I start by grabbing a cup. That's easy enough. Then, I must discover which container holds the coffee--improper selection leads to either bland hot water or worthless decaf. Once I've filled my cup, I need to navigate to the creams and sugars and stirrers. The colors of sweeteners are standardized, so I can be reasonably certain that I want two or three yellows. Milk can sometimes be trickier. Cream choices don't seem to be consistently offered. There's usually a half-and-half, and often a milk variant (skim, whole, two percent), and sometimes soy or almond. To make things worse, these options look almost identical.

### Stipulations
Ideally, these coffee serving stations should be quickly accessible to a multitude of people, one after another, First-In-First-Out.

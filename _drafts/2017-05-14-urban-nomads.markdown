As markets shuddered and cracked, investors looked for safer places to store their wealth. It was only natural for the hyper-wealthy to invest in real estate, in land. As the saying went, no one was making any more of it. They bought up skyscrapers in New York and Chicago, prairie fields in Missouri and Nebraska, and chunks of mountain in Colorado and Wyoming. They parceled off the beaches in California and Florida. Eventually there was no hovel that wasn't renovated, no isolated speck of country dirt that developers wouldn't try to squeeze a luxury tiny home into. The country was crowded, but beautiful. Glass towers glittered in nearly every direction. Most of them were empty.

Homes were parceled up and bought out from underneath their owners them. The middle class found their options for habitation fewer and fewer. Some tried to stay, hidden in the crawlspaces of their old homes, choking on the dust under their old steps. Others went to the streets, or, more and more frequently, the empty buildings that covered the landscape like giant tombstones.

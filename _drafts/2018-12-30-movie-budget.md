# The Data

I obtained this dataset from [Kaggle][Kaggle-TheMoviesDataset], the data science competition site. It contains metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the the MovieLens Dataset released on or before July 2017. Included is information on budget, release dates, languages, production company, as well as cast members. MovieLens also has user ratings and this dataset contains 26 million ratings from 270,000 users.

There are some discrepancies in the data from MovieLens and other sources such as Wikipedia and IMDB. For comparison, [here][Wikipedia-HighestGrossingMovies] is a list of the highest grossing movies according to Wikipedia.

# Conclusions

## Interesting Findings

- English language movie with the highest budget: Kidulthood (£600,000 in 2006 , equivalent to $751,597.56. There is some confusion though, as MovieLens suggests the budget to be $994,000.)

- Movie with the highest budget in any language: The Adolescence of Utena ($998,000 according to MovieLens; ¥120,000,000 or $1,086,840 according to Wikipedia)

- Movie with the highest revenue: Avatar ($2,787,965,000 according to MovieLens)

- Movie with the most user ratings: The Dark Knight, with 12,269 votes

- Movie with the highest average user rating: The Godfather, with an average rating of 8.5

- Movie with the most votes consistently rating it low: House of the Dead, with 106 votes averaging a 2.8 rating.

#### What is a "daemon"?
"Daemon" refers to a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the immediate control of an interactive user (thanks [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)). Daemons appear when discussing multitasking functionalities in computer processing.

#### Word Origin
Dæmon comes from the Latin word for the Ancient Greek [daimōn](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095657922) (δαίμων), meaning divider or alotter from Homer onward. The word refers to mythological creatures in ancient Greek and later Hellenistic religion. Gods could be daemons, but so could the incorporeal remnants of great men. Daemons can be harmless and beneficent (like a well-intentioned Zeus), or malicious (such as Lamia or [Clement](http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Clement)). ![Clem]({{ site.url }}/assets/Clem_2.jpg){: .center-image }

A group of programmers in [MIT's Project MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory#Project_MAC) borrowed the name from Maxwell's Demon.
